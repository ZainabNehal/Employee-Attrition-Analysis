Employee Attrition Analysis

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Employee attrition (also known as employee turnover) is a critical challenge faced by organizations. This project analyzes employee data to identify key factors influencing attrition and builds insights using Python and Power BI. The goal is to help HR teams and management make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Understand the patterns and causes of employee attrition.

Build predictive models to analyze attrition likelihood.

Create interactive dashboards in Power BI for visualization.

Provide actionable insights for decision-making.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Power BI (interactive dashboard & reports)

GitHub (project sharing & version control)

ðŸ”‘ Steps Followed

Data Collection â€“ Used employee dataset containing demographics, job roles, salaries, performance, etc.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing â€“ Handled missing values, encoding, and scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Identified trends using graphs and charts.

Model Building â€“ Implemented ML models to predict attrition (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).

Visualization â€“ Created a Power BI dashboard with slicers and charts.

Insights & Recommendations â€“ Highlighted strategies to reduce attrition.

ðŸ“Š Power BI Dashboard Features

Attrition by Department, Job Role, Age, Salary, Education

Attrition based on Years at Company, Training, and Performance

Interactive filters/slicers for deeper insights

KPIs showing Attrition Rate & Trends

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

Younger employees and entry-level workers showed higher attrition.

Low salary and lack of promotion opportunities increased attrition risk.

Employees with fewer training hours were more likely to leave.

Work-life balance played a significant role in retention.

ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/employee-attrition-analysis.git](https://github.com/ZainabNehal/Employee-Attrition-Analysis)


Navigate to project folder:

cd Employee_Data.csv


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run Jupyter Notebook or VS Code to explore the code.

Open Power BI file (.pbix) to view the dashboard.

ðŸ“Œ Future Scope

Deploy as a web app using Streamlit/Dash.

Integrate with real-time HR data.

Use advanced ML models (XGBoost, Neural Networks).
